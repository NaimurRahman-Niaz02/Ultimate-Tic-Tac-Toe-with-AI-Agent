# 🎮 Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe with AI Agent

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategic web game featuring an AI opponent where players compete across a nested 3x3 grid system to capture small boards and win the main match.


## 📌 Project Overview

This game is a modern web-based version of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe where a human player competes against an AI on a 9×9 grid made of nine smaller boards. Each move decides which board the next player must use, making the game more strategic than normal Tic-Tac-Toe. Players can turn the timer on or off, choose how much time each turn gets, decide who plays first, and select different difficulty levels. During the game, the interface shows previous moves, game statistics, and clear rules so players can easily understand and enjoy the gameplay.

####  🤖 Min-Max Algorithm for AI Agent

The AI uses the Min-Max algorithm to decide its moves by looking ahead at possible future game situations. It assumes the AI tries to make the best move while the human tries to block it, and then chooses the move that gives the safest winning chance. To make this process faster, Alpha-Beta pruning is used to skip checking moves that cannot improve the result. This allows the AI to think deeper and play smarter without slowing down the game.
